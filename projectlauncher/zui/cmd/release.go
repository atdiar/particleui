		// if bynaryen wasm-opt is present, use it to optimize the wasm file (TODO)
		// On project init check if wasm-opt is present, set a flag on the project manifest

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// releaseCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// releaseCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
